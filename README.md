# Cue

Cue is a web application designed for teaching assistants to facilitate holding remote, hybrid, and in-person office hours.

## Problem Statement

The pandemic has made managing office hours extra difficult as teaching assistants need to juggle watching the queue for updates, helping students on Zoom or in person according to their preferences, and keeping track of who is being helped and who is away from their computer. 

Our current solution is a Google Doc. This is completely anonymized, unsecure, lacks relevant information such as whether the student is online or in person, and makes it difficult to determine when a student is being helped and by whom.

## Value Proposition

Cue seeks to eliminate these concerns by requiring students to sign with their GitHub accounts and include essential information for the teaching assistants on queue entry; moreover, it gathers all course info for a given student into one place and allows them to easily see which teaching assistants are available and when office hours are open. It also offers finer controls for teaching assistants to manage the queue, and see when students are being helped by their co-teaching assistants. Finally, it only allows students to have control over their own queue entry for courses they are authorized for. A student can no longer view, modify, or remove other students' queue entries. 

This feature set provides teaching assistants with the tools necessary to run successful office hours regardless of the format by eliminating unnecessary burdens and redundant actions as well as providing them with consistent, relevant information and finer control over the queue.
